      Sitting in her room. She looked at the prahar lamp kept. The war didn't start now or couldn't be stopped now. She
      knew it was what she was given birth for, yet her heartaches. Her family, her husbands, her sons, and every man
      she knew were standing in the ground. For a moment the world stood still and she could see only one chariot moving
      forward. Krishna was speaking to her beloved Arjuna and at that time the flower that slipped off her hand was
      floating down towards the ground. She saw herself as a kid who was smarter than her brother but was always asked
      to go to the women's chamber saying war isn't for women. She always wondered if the war wasn't for women, how come
      they had to suffer the most? The flower was floating in the air still above the ground. She remembered the day
      when Arjuna won her and when she had sent Karna out of the swayamvara. It had to be done and there was no other
      way. The hurt in Karna's eyes would haunt her from then. The utter joy she felt when Arjuna took her to his mom
      and the devastation when told she would be married to all five. She knew at that moment too that this was the only
      way too. When her husband lost her during the gamble all the rage she felt within her was enough to bring the city
      down; when her saree was removed on the day when she was bleeding, the remorse, anger, and contempt was surpassed
      by her need for vengeance. The vengeance that insinuated her husbands every day. Her loose hair which was to be
      seen only on special moments was to be seen every day to remind them of the disgrace that happened to her. The
      petal of the flower now closer to the ground slightly graced the floor. People thought that it was her ego, her
      anger, her laughter, her remorse, her greed that caused the war between the cousins. Those were the people who
      didn't know the full story. She was just a very important piece, like a queen in the game of chess. She only
      protected her husbands and when in need did what had to be done. She was just a piece on the board like all the
      cousins but played by the same person. There had to be a balance, stability but that comes only after chaos. She
      picked the flower from the ground and placed it on the table. She looked at the chariot. The conch shells were
      blown and the war began.
