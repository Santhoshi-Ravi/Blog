      <h1>To Kill a mockingbird- A book review</h1>

        When you look at the review of the book " To kill a mockingbird" is often an emphasis on the racism that was predominant in those years and how Atticus and his family were among the handful of people who thought in a different light. I feel the book is so much more than that. It not only addresses an important social topic but also shows the innocence of a child. We relive our childhood and our playful yet brave notion of asking questions that we don't ask as we age. Why we don't ask is somewhat intriguing and everyone has a different opinion of it. Few say that this is what it is and it's how it has been done always. Others try to label the other person asking the "non-ideal" questions to discourage them to ask more. As time goes by we learn not to ask all these questions, at least to people whom we aren't comfortable with. This was one of the privileges of being a child I guess. You can ask what you want but you won't be held for it. Another thing that comes to mind is how Atticus tries to parent them both. They respect him and try to live by what he says not because he is terrifying but because he tries to reason with them as to why he asks them of something. It tells us that children are capable of trying to reason much more than we give them credit for. There are two quotes that I love from this book. The first being you need to live in the skin of others to understand why they do what they do. It's a very common quote and commonly used by people. Yet, the way that concept has been brought to life by the author shows us the difference between just saying the words and living by it. The second quote is " he seems nice. Yes, once you get to know people they are nice." This is true, especially the era in which we live. We are quick to jump to judge and have ideas about who one might be without spending the time to understand them nor getting to know them. For the most part, people are nicer than you seem to they are. Exceptions do occur. Before reading the book I never understood why it was so celebrated, but after reading it I understood it's giving the feeling of drinking coffee by the window on a rainy day.
