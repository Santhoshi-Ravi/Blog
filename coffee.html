        Our new norm of the day is hours of meeting, client calls, managing the household, the online classes of  children, preparing food, cleaning, and everything done enclosed in a space. It’s been a long time since you took a coffee break after working through the day, felt the warmth and smelled the aroma of the hot coffee. If it wasn’t for the pandemic, at least you could have ordered something in swiggy or zomato and had some evening snacks. Remember the time when your grandma made those delicious and hot bondas and samosas? Remember when everyone in the family had a plate of the freshly made pakodas and bajjis with the chutney you called by their colors?  You would love to make them, then sit together and relive the experience again as a family in this quarantine if only you knew how to make them. You did look at a lot of cooking videos but the thought that lingered in your mind was “ Well, I don’t have any of the ingredients as such. We can try these after the situation resolves.” What if we told you need not wait till then? What if we could help your family to relive those memories and offer your children to relish our South Indian snacks but instead of swiggy or zomato, you are their chef. We offer you the freshly made ingredients that you can use to make the tasty vadas and other items that can serve a family of four.


Its evening, you couldn’t prepare coffee for everyone because the meeting that was supposed to be short stretched for hours or you just had to complete the work that was assigned without further ado. Lucky for you, you had ordered the perfectly brewed coffee made just as you like it. After the long day, you open the cup and the aroma of the coffee fills the air around you. You take the coffee and stand next to the window sill. Well, however the day went you know the cup of coffee can fix it for you.
